2. Fast facts 
	● Generic test automation framework
		– Utilizes the keyword-driven testing approach 
		– Suitable for both “normal” test automation and ATDD 
	● Implemented with Python – Runs also on Jython (JVM) and IronPython (.NET) – Can be extended natively using Python or Java – Other languages supported via a remote interface 
	● Open source – Hosted on GitHub, Apache 2 license – Sponsored by Nokia Networks – Rich ecosystem and very active community
3. High level architecture
4. Simple keyword-driven syntax
5. Data-driven tests
6. Gherkin syntax
7. Higher level keywords
8. Simple test library API
9. Variables 
	● Easy to create: 
	● Override from the command line: ­­variable BROWSER:IE
10. Tagging 
	● Free metadata to categorize test cases 
	● Statistics by tags collected automatically 
	● Select test cases to be executed 
	● Specify which test cases are considered critical
11. Clear reports
12. Detailed logs
13. Different test libraries 
	● Standard libraries – Included in normal installation – OperatingSystem, Screenshot, String, Telnet, XML, … 
	● External libraries – Must be installed separately – Selenium2Library, SwingLibrary, DatabaseLibrary, AutoItLibrary, SSHLibrary, HTTPLibrary, …
	● Project and team specific libraries
14. Editor support 
	● RIDE 
	● Plugins for Eclipse, IntelliJ/PyCharm, ``SubLime``, TextMate, Vim, Emacs, Brackets, Atom, ...
15. Easy integration 
	● Test suites are created from files and directories – Trivial to store into any version control system 
	● Simple command line interface – Easy to start test execution by external tools 
	● Output also in XML format – All information in machine readable format – Outputs from different test runs can be combined 
	● Plugins for common CI and build tools – Jenkins, Ant, Maven
